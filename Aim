Abstract:
-) A polar projection-based algorithm is proposed to reduce the computational complexity associated with dimension reduction in unsupervised learning. 
-) This algorithm employs K-means clustering. 
-) A new distance metric is developed to account for peak consumption in cluster consumer load profiles. 
-) It is used to cluster the load profiles according to both total and peak consumption.
-) To accelerate the clustering process, a stochastic-based approach is developed to reduce the search space to find the cluster centers. 
-) Numerical results are presented which show a significant reduction in computational complexity using both polar-based and stochastic-based clustering compared to conventional approaches.
